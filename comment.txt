LAB6==================================================================
The likelihood for the EM algorithm is incorrect, particularly the truncated exponential pdf that you derived. 
You seemed to divide the a pdf of regular exponential distribution by another pdf of exponential distribution,
while it should be the pdf divided by cdf at c. The reason you might be able to use the maximum likelihood directly,
is because you also have not properly calculated the expectation, which should consist of two different kinds of parameters, 
lambda and lambda_k. Since lambda_k is known, you need to maximize the function over lambda. Please use this information to revise the EM algorithm and resubmit.
